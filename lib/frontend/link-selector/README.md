# @tuleap/link-selector

A user interface component to help select an item among heterogeneous groups of items. Contrary to `@tuleap/list-picker`, it can present groups with different behaviours. It does not watch the `<select>` element it is bound to. See [ADR 0001 Link Selector](./adr/0001-link-selector.md) for details.
