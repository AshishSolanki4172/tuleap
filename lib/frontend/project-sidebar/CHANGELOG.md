# Changelog

## In development

* In order to not clutter the sidebar when the number of linked projects is too big,
  a new configuration variable is added: `project.linked_projects.nb_max_projects_before_popover`.
  When the number of linked projects exceed this limit, then they are no more displayed in the sidebar,
  only in the popover on hover. Default is `5`.
* Bump vue: 3.2.37 -> 3.3.4

## 2.3.0

* Tools can have promoted items, they will be displayed as a sub list when the sidebar is expanded.
* Collapse of the sidebar is deprecated. A boolean `is_collapsible` is now part of the configuration to control the behavior.

## 2.2.4

* `process.env.NODE_ENV` is removed from the distributed files so the element can be used without a bundler

## 2.2.3

* Changes regarding the Tuleap icons have been re-introduced
* Release pipeline has been fixed (hopefully)
