# focus-navigation

Functions to help with keyboard navigation between related elements. Move the focus up or down in a common set of elements. To group elements in a common set, assign them a `data-navigation=<name of the set>` attribute. For example: `data-navigation=card`

_Note:_ This library _does not_ register keyboard event handlers, that's up to the caller.
