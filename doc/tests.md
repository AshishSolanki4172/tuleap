# Tests

We strongly encourage developers to apply TDD. Not only as a test tool
but as a design tool.

We apply the [Test
pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html#TheTestPyramid)
concept.

* [Unit test](./tests/unit-test.md) 
* [Integration](./tests/integration.md) 
* [End to end](./tests/end-to-end.md)
