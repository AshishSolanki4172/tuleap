# Layout

<code>.tlp-framed</code> and <code>.tlp-centered</code>

By default there isn't margins on the main container; this allows you to be able to use the full with of the viewport (for example when you use tabs).
However most of the time you will need to add some margins (for example when you use panes). This is achieving by using <code>.tlp-framed</code>
